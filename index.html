    <h1>Fakaalofa lahi atu, Welcome to My Blog!</h1> 

    <p> Here you'll find links to my technical blog which demonstrates my technical upskilling, and my core blog which reflects my growth. On this page I'll be sharing a little bit about myself so you can get to know me better. 
      I love board games, family game nights, baking, Asian eats, and life stories ðŸŒ±</p>

    <p>My Dad is from Avatele village and my Mum is from Lakepa. Here are a few pics of what I call home - one of them is me holding an 'Uga' aka coconut crab :)</p>
