    <h1> Sprint 2: Learning Plan</h1> 

    <h3 style="color: rgb(3, 153, 223);">Friday, 10 September 2021</h3> 
  
    <h3>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long term career goal is to become a Senior Salesforce Developer! 
    </p>

    <h3>What are my own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h3>
    <p>
      My strengths include my curiosity to learn, enthusiasm, and open mindedness. However, my limitations are polar opposite to my strengths and I struggle/battle with them whenever I learn. They include not thinking Iâ€™m good enough, not being confident, and overthinking minor problems which turn them into major problems! 
    </p>

    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) do I want to develop while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I want to focus on building my team working skills! I tend to be a doormat and agree with everything the group says just so we can complete the project. However, I want to be more intentional with how I contribute and know that what I contribute is of value! 
    </p>

    <h3>How will I manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h3>
    <p>
      I will focus on how I treat others and what I can do to help them! Whether that be helping them to learn, or helping them to understand how they can best help me as facilitators. I'll also work hard on the material and code on my end so my cohort and facilitators don't have to help me just because I was being slack. Open communication with people, be transparent and say I will do what I'll do.  
      Do the mahi get the treats! Open communication with others (be kinder to myself)
    </p>

    <h3>What will I do when things are building up and start getting to me?</h3>
    <p>
      I'll take breaks, journal, and re-evaluate what needs to be done and how I'm going to do it. That may include going for a walk, catching up with a friend, or watching a movie to clear my head and reset it. That way I can come back to my studies refocused! 
    </p>

    <h3>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3>
    <p>
      I'll seek help using the Slack platform. The entire cohort are really lovely and they're always willing to help! I also have the help of the facilitators who are just as lovely! 
    </p>

    <h3>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
    <p>
      Honestly, the entire team have been super lovely and I have no expectations! If anything, they've exceeded any expectations I would've had! 
    </p>

    <h3>What commitments do I have?</h3>
    <p>
      My Dad was the sole income earner of our family and recently lost his job due to covid so I've had to pick up part time work to help cover our bills and support the family. I'm lucky enough to work for 3BF - an organisation which is linked to KidsCoin. We're currently helping Pasifika people get into the tech industry. I've told them that I am at devacademy and will be prioritising this over work so they've created a workload to fit around my studies. I can work from home and when I want to so my plans is to work 2 hours every night before I go to sleep (7pm -9pm). So far, my schedule is all over the place but I'm managing everything well and find I still have time for myself. However, I'll have to cut back some more hours when bootcamp starts but work is very understanding! 
    </p>

    <h1>Feedback from Naomi (my facilitator)</h1>
    <p>I need to make more commits on github in order to show them that I am sticking to my learning plan and working on my time management! This is great feedback as I have to stick to what I'm going to say I have to do and I will be held accountable for what I do and do not do. </p>
