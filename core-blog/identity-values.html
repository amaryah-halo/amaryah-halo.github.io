    <h1>Sprint 1: Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1> 

    <h3 style="color: rgb(3, 153, 223);">Friday, 3 September 2021</h3>

    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
    <p>
      I used to be a housekeeper for a hotel and the working environment wasn't always best. We worked in pairs and covered a floor of the hotel each. I was paired with my friend who was having a hard day because of something that had recently happened in her life. Because of this she made a mistake that I should've reported her for. However, I weighed out everything that had been happening that day and made the decision to fix the problem, keep it between ourselves, and have the 
      conversation on what she should do next time instead of doing what she did. I'm happy with the action I made - I put people first before my job. However, if it did become a repeated occurence (which it didn't) I would've had to make 
      the decision to report her to my manager.

    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>
      In my culture family, community, and looking out for eachother are central in all we do. For example, whenever we go to Niue our family will have cooked us an umu of taro, fish, and chicken which 
      they'll bring over for us to eat as soon as we land. They'll also drop of baskets of coconuts and uga's throughout our whole trip. Having that strong family and community culture has influenced me to always
      value others over myself while still valuing what I can bring to the table. My culture has humbled me to also learn that everyone no matter what background or status someones has they still always have something to bring to the table. My identity
      is my family and they're a strong pillar of for my values and who I am :)

    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
    <p>
      Being resilient when it comes to coding is something that I have built up over the past few years. I know that this will help me at EDA
      when I hit a roadblock. I understand that although I don't understand it in the moment, if I keep chipping away at it and getting help it will eventually 
      fall into place. I just have cross a few hurdles first. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Having an open-mind also creates an awareness for those around me and an awareness for myself. This will help me in growing together with those in my cohort
      as well as growing as an individual. Being kind also intersects alongside having an open-mind. When coding becomes intense it can overwhelming and stressful. Being in 
      an environment where everyone is kind is super helpful. And always remembering to be kind to yourself helps out a lot as well.

    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, 
      how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
    <p>
      When I was interning at Foodstuffs North Island I came across a roadblock which involved seeking help externally from a company called AKQA. However, I don't have the 'right' to contact
       them as they weren't in my immediate team and I wasn't interning for them. I took my problems to my manager who put me in contact with someone who I could reach out to from AKQA. Through 
       open communication and transparency I was able to solve the problem. For me personally, a lot of my problems will probably be solved if I took that first step like the one I just mentioned.
