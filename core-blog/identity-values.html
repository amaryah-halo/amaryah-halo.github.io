    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1> 

    <h3 style="color: rgb(3, 153, 223);">Friday, 3 September 2021</h3>

    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
    <p>
      I used to be a housekeeper for a hotel and the working environment wasn't always best. We worked in pairs and covered a floor of the hotel each. I was paired with my friend who was having a hard day because of something that had recently happened in her life. Because of this she made a mistake that I should've reported her for. However, I weighed out everything that had been happening that day and made the decision to fix the problem, keep it between ourselves, and have the 
      conversation on what she should do next time instead of doing what she did. I'm happy with the action I made - I put people first before my job. However, if it did become a repeated occurence (which it didn't) I would've had to make 
      the decision to report her to my manager. 
    </p>

    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>
      In my culture family, community, and looking out for eachother are central in all we do. For example, whenever we go to Niue our family will have cooked us an umu of taro, fish, and chicken which 
      they'll bring over for us to eat as soon as we land. They'll also drop of baskets of coconuts and uga's throughout our whole trip. Having that strong family and community culture has influenced me to always
      value others over myself while stilling valuing what I can bring to the table. My culture has humbled me to also learn that everyone no matter what background or status has something to bring to the table. My identity
      is my family and they're a strong pillar of for my values and who I am :)

    <h3>How will I manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h3>
    <p>
      I will focus on how I treat others and what I can do to help them! Whether that be helping them to learn, or helping them to understand how they can best help me as facilitators. I'll also work hard on the material and code on my end so my cohort and facilitators don't have to help me just because I was being slack. Open communication with people, be transparent and say I will do what I'll do.  
      Do the mahi get the treats! Open communication with others (be kinder to myself)
    </p>

    <h3>What will I do when things are building up and start getting to me?</h3>
    <p>
      I'll take breaks, journal, and re-evaluate what needs to be done and how I'm going to do it. That may include going for a walk, catching up with a friend, or watching a movie to clear my head and reset it. That way I can come back to my studies refocused! 
    </p>

    <h3>How and where will I seek help in a timely way?</h3>
    <p>
      I'll seek help using the Slack platform. The entire cohort are really lovely and they're always willing to help! I also have the help of the facilitators who are just as lovely! 
    </p>

    <h3>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
    <p>
      Honestly, the entire team have been super lovely and I have no expectations! If anything, they've exceeded any expectations I would've had! 
    </p>

    <h3>What commitments do I have?</h3>
    <p>
      My Dad was the sole income earner of our family and recently lost his job due to covid so I've had to pick up part time work to help cover our bills and support the family. I'm lucky enough to work for 3BF - an organisation which is linked to KidsCoin. We're currently helping Pasifika people get into the tech industry. I've told them that I am at devacademy and will be prioritising this over work so they've created a workload to fit around my studies. I can work from home and when I want to so my plans is to work 2 hours every night before I go to sleep (7pm -9pm). So far, my schedule is all over the place but I'm managing everything well and find I still have time for myself. However, I'll have to cut back some more hours when bootcamp starts but work is very understanding! 
    </p>

    <h1>Feedback from Naomi (my facilitator)</h1>
    <p>I need to make more commits on github in order to show them that I am sticking to my learning plan and working on my time management! This is great feedback as I have to stick to what I'm going to say I have to do and I will be held accountable for what I do and do not do. </p>
