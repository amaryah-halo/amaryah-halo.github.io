    <h1>Sprint 2: What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1> 

    <h3 style="color: rgb(3, 153, 223);">Saturday, 11 September 2021</h3> 
    
    <div class="row">
      <img class = "middle-pic" src="../images/diagram.jpg" alt="diagram">
      <p>The diagram above shows where the margin, border, and padding is located on any content. Content can include headings, paragraphs, and images etc.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Margin</h2>
    <p>
     The margin is the space around the border as seen in the diagram above. To simply put it, a margin is the space outside 
     of something (i.e. an image, paragraph, heading etc). If you were to increase the margin size of something, the size of the content will remain 
     at the same size. However, the space around it will increase and push away any other content which is near it. For example, an image 
     which is increasing in margin size will push away any text that is surrounding it. To adjust the size you can either use percentage, pixels, and so on. 
     You can also adjust a specific margin using margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, and margin-bottom. 
    </p>

    <h2>Border</h2>
    <p>
      A border is the space between the margin and padding. It increases in relevance to the padding and content - however, if the 
      margin is increased the border and everything inside of it remains at the same size.  
    </p>

    <h2>Padding</h2>
    <p>
      The padding is the space directly outside of the content and within the border as seen in the diagram above. If you were to increase the padding size of your content, 
      the size of the content will also change. This is the key difference between padding and margins. Padding will change the size of the content whereas margins won't. Padding is 
      usually used to create a bit of white space surrounding the content section. Similar to margin, specific areas can be altered using padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, and padding-bottom. To put it in simple terms, 
      padding controls the inside of an element and margin controls the outside of an element. The border just kinda sits in between.
